Allows users to pull data from Twitter using the Twitter API and run a machine learning based analysis on an individual Twitter user (or users)

Run:

python3 user_stats.py 'TWITTER_HANDLE'

This will run the user income estimator and will output the three most likely income groups they could belong to, along with the top words of the most significant topic.
